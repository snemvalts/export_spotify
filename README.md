export_spotify
==============
Export your Spotify account's track list, no premium account needed.  
Run in python3 with the following parameters: access token w/ user-library-read permission (maybe obtained from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks/)) and your [username](https://www.spotify.com/account/overview/).

WARNING: the code was written a long time ago and I don't understand why I wrote it this way.
